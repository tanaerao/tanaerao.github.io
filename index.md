I'm currently a Research Fellow at [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) on the Global Catastrophic Risks Cause Prioritization team. Open Philanthropy is a large philanthropic funder that aims to maximize the expected value of the good we accomplish. My research mostly supports our grantmaking in AI safety, a field aimed at addressing catastrophic risks from advanced artificial intelligence.

I moved to Berkeley, CA in January 2025. Other places I've lived are Ottawa, Brisbane, Oxford, and London, in chronological order.

In a past life, I did an MSc in Economics at the LSE and a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford. I represented both of those universities in competitive debating, including running the competitive debating wing of the Oxford Union. I was also a VC intern at [Lionheart Ventures](https://www.lionheart.vc/) (AI, mental health, portfolio impact measurement) and a generalist researcher at [Taimaka](https://taimaka.org/) (global health, malnutrition, cost effectiveness analysis).
