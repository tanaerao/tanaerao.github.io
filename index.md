## Tanae Rao

Previously, I was an MSc student at the [LSE](https://suboptimal.substack.com/)'s Department of Economics, and studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford for undergrad. I was also an intern at [Lionheart Ventures](https://www.lionheart.vc/), did generalist research at [Taimaka](https://taimaka.org/), wrote/edited for the [Oxford Political Review](https://oxfordpoliticalreview.com/) and was pretty involved in university-level competitive debate.

I [write](https://suboptimal.substack.com/) blogposts and short stories for fun. Outside of work, I'm currently thinking about persuasiveness in LLMs, how we should interpret information from prediction markets, and finding things to explore in London.

If you're a Ted Chiang fan / guitar player / have hot takes about stuff, send me an [email](mailto:raotanae@gmail.com)!
